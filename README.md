# River Reports (WDI project 2)
##Overview

River Reports is a site designed to allow a user to sign into an account and record river data and information 
in a format that can easily be shared with other users or saved as a private memo. There is also a stories 
section where users can record and share their adventures in a format that relies less on river conditon 
informtion.
